In pulsar timing, we generally assume that <b>the average shape of pulse profiles is stable over the timescale of decades</b>; that is, that if we observe many pulses averaged together from one observation to the next, that they are intrinsically similar. We examined the pulse profiles from the <a href="http://nanograv.org/">North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav)</a> <a href="https://nanograv.github.io/11yr_dataset/">11-year data set</a> to test this assumption and see <b>how they might vary in time</b>. Most of our pulsars show stable profiles though a few do show changes, likely due to the effects of the interstellar medium as the pulses propagate through or due to imperfect polarization calibration. We were able to <b>quantify how variable the pulse profiles</b> were in our data set. Changes in pulse profile changes are detrimental to the accuracy of pulsar timing and must be incorporated into the timing models in the future.

												<p><b>Image</b>: Pulsars are known to have different pulse shapes as a function of radio frequency. This variation has been well known for decades and is accounted for in our timing of millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we test how those pulse shapes vary in time (Data from: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1694">Dolch et al. 2014</a>).</p>

													       											Precision timing of millisecond pulsars over years
															and decades allows us to build <b>models of radio-pulse
															arrival times of incredible accuracy</b>. These models
															account for the pulsar's spin period, its evolution, the dispersion of radio pulses in
															the interstellar medium, and many other effects. Developing precision timing models for many pulsars allows their use as <b>tools to test fundamental physics</b>.
		    
												  </li>


												  <li>

												    NANOGrav requires <b>extremely sensitive measurements of millisecond-pulsar pulse profiles</b> in order to reach its goal of characterizing the low-frequency gravitational wave universe. We use some of the largest radio telescopes in the world to obtain our measurements.
												   
												  </li>
												  <li>
												    The emission from pulsars on the timescale of a rotation (observed as a "single pulse") varies greatly. However, the <b>average pulse profile is highly stable</b>. This is somewhat like the difference between <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b>. However, while the average pulse profile for most pulsars is very stable, we require them to be absolutely stable for precision timing, or to be able to account for any variations.

												<p><b>Image</b>: The method for aligning a model pulse profile (red) with an observed profile (blue) with a simulated deviation.

													  When we try to determine when a pulse arrives at our telescope, we fit a model template shape to each pulse profile we observe. When there is a deviation in the pulse shape, <b>our estimate of the arrival time will be skewed if not corrected for</b>.

													</li>
													<li>

			The usual method for fitting the template shape to the data profile is to cross correlate one with the other, which finds the maximum overlap between the two. However, we developed a new method to maximize the "alignment" of the model with the data, <b>thus allowing us to identify deviations automatically.</b>	
													</li>

													<li>

													  													 We used six different metrics to quantify the variability seen in each pulsar, each of which was <b>sensitive to different types of variability across our observations</b>.

													</li>


													<li>

													  Our method was <b>insensitive to true shifts in the pulse emission</b>. That is, if the pulse was actually delayed but its shape was not distorted, since we automatically try to maximize the alignment, we are unable to quantify this effect in this specific analysis. However, other methods are able to capture both effects.

														<p><b>Image</b>: A dynamic spectrum showing pulse intensity (darker = brighter) as a function of time (horizontal axis) and radio frequency (vertical axis).

														<ul>
															<li>

															  Much of the variability we see is caused by <i>scintillation</i>, the same type of effect as stars twinkling in the atmosphere though for radio waves moving through the interstellar medium (see figure). This causes certain frequencies of the pulse to be brighter randomly. Since profiles vary as a function of frequency, the <b>average pulse shape will then be slightly different due to this random weighting</b>.
										
															</li>

										
															<li>


															  Some variability is due to other interstellar medium propagation effects. Scattering in the interstellar medium causes some parts of the intrinsic pulse to arrive later by a very slight amount, <b>causing a long tail in the arriving pulse emission</b>. Variations in the amount of scattering causes variations in the length of this tail.


																									    </li>
															<li>

															  <b>Uncorrected instrumental effects also cause profile variability</b>. Bad calibration of the data will cause distortions in the pulse shape, as will radio frequency interference or errors in the hardware when the data were taken.


															<li>

															  For some of the variability seen, we cannot provide definite explanations but have <b>ruled out possible candidates</b>.
